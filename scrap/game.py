        Receiving the game scores tab element, this function retrieves all players informations displayed there as a pd df.

        2- We get each 'scorer' in the 'team_goals_element' = one element by scorer (one scorer can have multiple goals)
        3- For each of scorer, we get both "p" elements:
            As of 10/02/2024, there are two elements, one looks always empty but might be kept for particularly long names
            We read them both and join them.
            JUST FOUND OUT : it's the minutes of the goals, in case it's a real game and not mpg game
        4- We count the number of 'svg' elemnts = number of things displayed close to his names
        TODO: Find a way to classify those elements (real goals, mpg goals, goals saved etc.), in an other function ?
            For that, I recommend using 'print(scorer.get_attribute("innerHTML"))' and checking in an other window
            to understund each differences.

        Infos are saved as a list of dicts with one element per players in the scores tab element, structured as :
        {name:,nb_goals:,team:}
        Then, returned in a pandas dataframe

        Notes : not working for real games because of the "Dernières confrontation" at the end of the page. We retrieved both tabs
        both goal scorers etc. I didn't find a way to catch only the first tab easily, but should be doable
